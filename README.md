## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Basic Javascript


### What I learned

This project helped me brush up on the basics of HTML and CSS as I worked on a web development project after some time.
To take this project a little further, I decided to add some basic transitions and animations and also a light/dark mode theme using basic javascript.


### Useful resources

- [Css Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This helped me get a refresher for css flexbox.
- [Toggle switch css](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This article was helpful in creating the toggle switch for the theme switch.
